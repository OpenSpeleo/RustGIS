Raster coordinate systems are looked up by EPSG code in the PROJ definitions of the
[crs-definitions](https://crates.io/crates/crs-definitions) crate (CC0-1.0), compiled into the
app. The codes it lacks (EPSG 9020–20003, `crates/data/src/raster/epsg_gap.rs`) are from the
[EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset](https://epsg.org) v12.029 (© IOGP, under its
[terms of use](https://epsg.org/terms-of-use.html)), written as PROJ definitions by PROJ 9.8.

The GeoLibre tool suite ([geolibre-rust](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-rust), MIT, built
on [whitebox-wasm](https://github.com/opengeos/whitebox-wasm), MIT) is not part of RustGIS: the
desktop app and command line run its separately downloaded `geolibre` runner, and the web app
loads its WebAssembly runner (the `geolibre-wasm` npm package, from jsDelivr) when asked. Its
tool names, descriptions and categories come from the runner's manifests.

Icons are original vector drawings in code (`crates/ui-egui/src/icons.rs`). Fonts are not
bundled: the interface uses an installed system sans-serif when one is found, otherwise the
Ubuntu Light face that ships inside `epaint_default_fonts` (Ubuntu Font Licence 1.0).
