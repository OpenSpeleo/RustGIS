# Layouts and Reports

## Layouts

Home › New Layout adds a page layout (Letter to A0, landscape or portrait) with a map frame,
title, legend, north arrow, scale bar and a dynamic credits line. Layouts open as tabs next to
the maps; while one is open, its groups lead the Publish tab:

- **Map frames**: rectangle, circle and ellipse frames, or polygon and lasso frames drawn on the
  page. Each frame shows a map of the project at its own centre and scale; Shift-drag a frame to
  pan its map, double-click it to match the map view, or set the scale in its properties.
  **Grid** draws a labelled graticule over a frame; **Extent Indicator** outlines another frame's
  extent (an overview map).
- **Map surrounds**: north arrow, scale bar, legend, table frame (a layer's attribute table) and
  chart frame (a bar chart of a numeric field), plus a neatline or backdrop. A legend shows what
  its frame draws: only layers with a feature at the frame's scale (through their definition
  query, display filters and scale range) and, for Unique Values, only the classes those features
  have, with `<all other values>` only when some feature falls in it. Graduated Colors and
  Proportional Symbols list their classes as they are (they are taken from the kept features when
  the symbology is applied). A layer that draws
  nothing there, such as an empty one, is left out, in layouts saved before this too. Tick **All
  classes** in its properties (`"allClasses": true`) to list every class of every visible layer
  instead, and **Hide other values** (`"hideOther": true`) to leave `<all other values>` out of
  the legend in either mode (the features it stands for are still drawn).
- **Text** and **Dynamic Text**: `{date}`, `{time}`, `{scale}`, `{map}`, `{crs}`, `{page}`,
  `{pages}`, `{pageName}` and `{layout}` fill in when the page is drawn. **Picture** places a PNG
  or JPEG.
- **Map Series**: one page per feature of an index layer, with the frame zoomed to each feature;
  step through pages, refresh, and export every page into one PDF.
- Click an element to select it, drag to move, drag its handles to resize, and edit it in the
  properties panel. The wheel zooms the page.
- **Export** writes PDF (every map series page) or PNG; **Print** opens the PDF in the system
  viewer; **Save Layout File** and **Import Layout** move layouts between projects
  (`.rgislayout`).

## Reports

**Publish › New Report** lists the selected layer's records page after page; the **Report** pane
previews it and sets it up.

- **Data**: pick the detail **Fields** (or **Autofill Fields**), **Group** records by up to four
  fields (each group gets a heading and its own statistics), add **Statistics** (count, sum,
  mean, minimum, maximum), a **Dynamic Picture** per record (a field holding a PNG/JPEG path relative to the saved
  project's folder, or base64 image data), **Attachments** (a field listing each record's files,
  separated by `;`; image files show when they're inside the project's folder), and a **Chart Frame**
  (records, or a field's sum, per category).
- **Report Section**: **Supplemental Pages** of text before or after the records, **New
  Template** and **Existing Template** (a page layout drawn as a report page), a **Related
  Report** appended after this one, and **Subreports** (each record's related records through a
  relationship, listed beneath it).
- A where clause or the layer's selection limits the records; a sort field orders them within
  their groups.
- **Publish › Report**: **Export Report** writes a PDF (or the first page as PNG); **Save As Report
  File** keeps the report, and **Report Template** its design without the data source, to start
  reports on other layers (**Publish › Import Report**).

## Presentations and notebooks

**Publish › New Presentation** starts a presentation with a title page; the **Presentation** pane
previews, edits and plays it.

- **Page**: a **Map** page shows the map view as it is now, a **Blank** page shows text on a
  coloured page, an **Image** page a picture with a caption, and a **Video** page a video file or
  URL with an optional poster picture.
- Each page has a title, speaker notes and a duration (for **Play**), and can move up or down.
- **Publish › Presentation › Export Presentation** writes a self-contained HTML slideshow (arrow
  keys, `N` for notes, `P` to play; videos play in place), a PDF, or the first page as PNG.
  **Save As Presentation File** keeps it to import into other projects.

**Analyze › New Notebook** starts a notebook of text and command cells; **Add and Open** opens a
RustGIS (`.rgisnb`) or Jupyter (`.ipynb`) notebook. A command cell runs one command per line
(`id {json}`, as in scripts) and shows each command's result beneath it. Notebooks save in
either format.
